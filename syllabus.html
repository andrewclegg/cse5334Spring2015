                            This course is designed to teach you, at the graduate level, data mining algorithms for analyzing very large amounts of data.  
                            The topics include data extraction, exploratory data analysis, visualization, 
                            classification, clustering, frequent itemsets, search engine basics, recommender systems, dimensionality reduction etc.

                            At the end of the semester you should: 
                            <ul>

                            This course covers a wide variety of topics that are not covered in a single book.
                            Some of the topics covered in the class will be found in one of the text books given below.
                            If none covers the topic, the instructor will point to the appropriate resources and also provide the slides.
                            The mnemonics MMDS, DMA, ISLR and IIR will be used refer to these books in the readings.

                                In addition, there are some "classic" data mining books that are great references.
                                These books are optional but great to have anyway!

<p>
                    <strong>Make-ups:</strong>
                        Make-ups for graded activities may be arranged if your absence is caused by
                        illness or work/personal emergency. A written explanation (including supporting
                        documentation) must be submitted to the Instructor. If the explanation is acceptable, an
                        alternative to the graded activity will be arranged. Make-up arrangements must be arranged
                        <i>prior</i> to the scheduled due date. 
</p>

                    <p>

                    <strong>Late days: </strong>
                    Each student has <b>5</b> late days to use at his or her discretion for the problem sets and programming assignments. One cannot use more than <b>2</b> days for one assignment or problem set without prior approval from the instructors. Please reserve your late days for legitimate emergencies. Each late day constitutes a 24-hour extension; you cannot split late days into smaller increments. If two partners on a programming exercise want to take a late day, they must contribute two days from their allotment; either one from each of them, or, with permission, two days from the person with extra late days.   
                    </p>

<p>
                    <strong>Late penalties:</strong>
Once a student runs out of late days, any late submissions are penalized at a rate of <b>50%</b> per day. No assignment may be handed in more than <b>2</b> days late.
